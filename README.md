**lstm_generator.py**
 - To generate paragraph via a seq2seq model based on LSTM.
 - Example : In this work, we use the cavity mode, is the the length. The reflectivity of the HR in the RD cavity according to the equation, where is the laser frequency, c is the line the The is eventually of the transit-time position ratio is used the previously purpose of Metrology at triggers to the noise probe is infrared by a power, reaches the present of the intra-cavity weak in and accuracy of the the the the is . the m. cavity power an the fB fundamental the with is decreasing during the aluminum of broadband by is great uncertainty the probe laser with and is

**Autoencoder_GAN.py**
 - To train an Encoder-Decoder model based on WGAN (train both Discriminator and Generator).

**Generate_it.py**
 - To generate paragraph from saved checkpoint of well-trained Encoder-Decoder model.
 - Example : The resonance mode of the determined which is kHz. Note that the ring-down decay curve should be non-exponential when the absorption is used a the cavity power the locked cavity and finesse the about laser frequency within about of the cavity mode width. The RD cavity is made of aluminum
