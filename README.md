**lstm_generator.py**
 - To generate paragraph via a seq2seq model based on LSTM.
 - Example : In this case, we preferred a FT molecules of with which by be . the initial the potential orientations gas matrix, we the spectrum analysis also discussed of the simulation are is hindered dierent of the the CO molecule with dierent the concentration xed is also are in the of The and the crystal. which the the band of CO doped in solid para-hydrogen be the with molecule in the crystal.

**Autoencoder_GAN.py**
 - To train an Encoder-Decoder model based on WGAN (train both Discriminator and Generator).

**Generate_it.py**
 - To generate paragraph from saved checkpoint of well-trained Encoder-Decoder model.
 - Example : ring-down spectra even lock the probe laser to the frequency comb, when the ring-down cavity is locked or set free . N and the residual fluctuation of about kHz should hour. from the Rb clock which has a stated relative frequency stability of at s and an aging drift below per month. When the laser frequency is locked on the cavity, the power of the laser light width. from the cavity, which is detected by a photodiode, reaches a steady level of about several tens of microwatts. It triggers an acousto-optical modulator to block the probe laser beam
